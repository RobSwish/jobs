**Location:** Manchester city centre

**Do you want to work on stuff that matters?** 

[Well Pharmacy](https://www.well.co.uk) is the the UK’s largest independent pharmacy with over 760 stores across the UK. Our mission as a company is to build the best prescription experience in the UK. 

[Well Digital](https://blog.well.co.uk/well-digital/) is a startup team creating new world-class digital products and services. We have a big ambition: to bring pharmacy into the digital age. 

Since we started Well Digital [just over a year ago](https://blog.well.co.uk/one-year-of-well-digital-1411482bda85/), we’ve launched the UK’s first Viagra subscription service and built a new [digital NHS prescription delivery service](https://blog.well.co.uk/were-building-a-better-pharmacy-50bc2e04cd97/). 

Our customers already love our products: metrics are strong, and most of our initial growth has been through word of mouth.

As our Head of Growth, your role will be to accelerate this growth without compromising on customer experience or retention. You’ll need to foster a culture of experimentation and growth through product, marketing and data.

You will work with the marketing team in our wider business to build our brand across the UK.
