# Head of Operations at [Well Digital](https://blog.well.co.uk/well-digital/)

**Salary:** £80k+  

**Location:** Manchester city centre

**Do you want to work on stuff that matters?** 

[Well Pharmacy](https://www.well.co.uk) is the the UK’s largest independent pharmacy with over 760 stores across the UK. Our mission as a company is to build the best prescription experience in the UK. 

[Well Digital](https://blog.well.co.uk/well-digital/) is a startup team creating new world-class digital products and services. We have a big ambition: to bring pharmacy into the digital age. 

Since we started Well Digital [just over a year ago](https://blog.well.co.uk/one-year-of-well-digital-1411482bda85/), we’ve launched the UK’s first Viagra subscription service and built a new [digital NHS prescription delivery service](https://blog.well.co.uk/were-building-a-better-pharmacy-50bc2e04cd97/). 

We’ve already got lots of happy customers, served from a small fulfilment operation. 

We’re now looking for an experienced, ambitious operator to help us scale our digital business. 

We want to create loyal customers by giving them a brilliant experience using our services. 

We already have a £16m wholesale distribution centre, with high levels of automation. As Head of Operations you will build on this to create a national-scale ecommerce fulfilment operation to get the right products to customers at the right time. 

## What you’ll do

- lead customer support, fulfilment and pharmacy/regulatory services for our digital business
- build a world-class operations team from scratch
- figure out how to maintain the same level of care for each of our customers at scale through investment in people and automation
- lead the setup and scale up of an industry-leading central fulfilment operation, using levels of automation not seen before in UK pharmacy
- keep GPs and their staff happy by solving some of their problems and building their trust in our services
- work closely with the wider digital team to build tools that support operations e.g. our in-house PharmOS platform
- bake patient safety in to everything we do

You’ll be part of the leadership team building and running our digital business. 

You will work closely with our distribution centre, wholesale and buying teams.
