# Senior Android Engineer at [Well Digital](https://blog.well.co.uk/well-digital/)

**Salary:** £50k+  

**Location:** Manchester city centre

**Do you want to work on stuff that matters?** 

[Well Pharmacy](https://www.well.co.uk) is the the UK’s largest independent pharmacy with over 760 stores across the UK. Our mission as a company is to build the best prescription experience in the UK. 

[Well Digital](https://blog.well.co.uk/well-digital/) is a startup team creating new world-class digital products and services. We have a big ambition: to bring pharmacy into the digital age. 

Since we started Well Digital [just over a year ago](https://blog.well.co.uk/one-year-of-well-digital-1411482bda85/), we’ve launched the UK’s first Viagra subscription service and built a new [digital NHS prescription delivery service](https://blog.well.co.uk/were-building-a-better-pharmacy-50bc2e04cd97/). 

Our customers already love our products: metrics are strong, and most of our initial growth has been through word of mouth.

We’re looking for a product-aware Android engineer to help us build the UK’s leading digital pharmacy service. 

We’ve been testing our iPhone app for a couple of months, and now we’re ready to start building on Android, too. 

You'll work closely with our designers and the rest of our engineering team, shaping the development of our product to ensure we're making the most of the Android platform. 

As a team, you’ll be trusted to build the right things in the right way to drive customer growth and satisfaction. 

We want a mobile team that’s evenly balanced, with Android and iOS on equal footing. Our design team understand Android best practices and care deeply about providing a slick native experience: we want to delight each platform’s users.

Our iPhone app is native Swift talking to a serverless backend written in Go. We make extensive use of AWS services. We’ve also built a back office web system (PharmOS) using React. We’ve not started building on Android yet. 

## What you’ll do

- lead the development of our Android app
- step into backend dev and/or design work - we like to mix it up
- build, test and operate digital services to meet customer needs, taking responsibility for the quality of code you produce
- participate in our in-house support, and potentially out-of-hours support rota
