# Senior Web Engineer at [Well Digital](https://blog.well.co.uk/well-digital/)

**Salary:** £50k+  

**Location:** Manchester city centre

**Do you want to work on stuff that matters?** 

[Well Pharmacy](https://www.well.co.uk) is the the UK’s largest independent pharmacy with over 760 stores across the UK. Our mission as a company is to build the best prescription experience in the UK. 

[Well Digital](https://blog.well.co.uk/well-digital/) is a startup team creating new world-class digital products and services. We have a big ambition: to bring pharmacy into the digital age. 

Since we started Well Digital [just over a year ago](https://blog.well.co.uk/one-year-of-well-digital-1411482bda85/), we’ve launched the UK’s first Viagra subscription service and built a new [digital NHS prescription delivery service](https://blog.well.co.uk/were-building-a-better-pharmacy-50bc2e04cd97/). 

Our customers already love our products: metrics are strong, and most of our initial growth has been through word of mouth.

We’re looking for a product-aware web engineer to help us build the UK’s leading digital pharmacy service. 

We’ve been testing our iPhone app for a couple of months, and we’ve just started building on web too. 

You'll work closely with our designers and the rest of our engineering team, shaping the development of our product to give our customers the best experience on web.
 
As a team, you’ll be trusted to build the right things in the right way to drive customer growth and satisfaction. 

Our iPhone app is native Swift talking to a serverless backend written in Go. We make extensive use of AWS services. We’ve also built a back office web system (PharmOS) using React. 

## What you’ll do

- lead frontend development of our digital pharmacy service
- step into backend dev and/or design work - we like to mix it up
- build, test and operate digital services to meet customer needs, taking responsibility for the quality of code you produce
